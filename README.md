# Shade: CS2 Hack Base

## 🤔 What is this?
**Shade** is a simple hack base for Counter-Strike 2. This project does not provide a proper implementation of a cheat for this game. It is more like a manual on how to start coding cheats, since this is my first project in C++ ever. I am sure that you will find a lot of bugs, bad solutions, etc.

For educational purposes only.

## 🛠️Features
- A simple in-game menu via GameOverlayRenderer64.dll hooking
- Simple ESP (health, bounding box, name, skeleton, ammo, weapon)
- World ESP (currently for dropped weapons only)
- Glow (players, dropped weapons)
- Viewmodel Modulation (FOV and viewmodel FOV)

## 🔄 WIP 
- Player chams modulation
- World modulation
- Rage
- Movement things
- Visually appealing menu

## ⚠️ Detection
**This base is 100% detected.** I have not tried to bypass VAC or other anti-cheat systems.

## 📋 Requirements
- C++ Standart / 20
- Inject Method / LoadLibrary
